About Girls Who Code
</h1>
<p>
The time management website you are viewing was created by the Girls Who Code club

at North Central College. After 20 weeks of learning to code, we have mastered several skills by

working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This project was a great exposure to the world of

computer science and being part of a this club inspires girls all around the world to pursue

working in a field of technology. The Girls Who Code club in Naperville focuses on not just

teaching girls to code, but also on educating them to build powerful friendships with other girls

and coming together to make a community impact using coding. We hope you enjoy using our project 

and hope it comes to full use
