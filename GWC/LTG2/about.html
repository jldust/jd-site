I’m 12 years old and I’m going on to 13.
I go to a school in Illinois and I love Math but I suck at Language Arts.
The reason why I chose to make this website is because I want to raise awareness about our environment and how we should recycle things that need to be recycled.
WE AS PART OF THE ENVIRONMENT SHOULD KEEP IT CLEAN!

I am 17 years old and I am a junior at Naperville North High School in Illinois. I play table tennis competitively both in school and out of school. I am planning on majoring in Computer Science in college, and thought that Girls Who Code would be a good experience for me. With global warming a pressing problem in today’s society, taking care of the environment should be a priority. We made the Littering Game as a way for people to become more aware of our environmental problems.

I am 13 years old and go to Washington Junior High School in Illinois. I am a figure skater, and I skate 5-6 days a week. My favorite subject in school is math, and I care a lot about doing well in school. I want to raise awareness about the environment to people across the world. We need to clean up the mess we’ve made and recycle whenever we can. We should be living alongside the earth, not controlling it.

I am 13 years old and go to Jefferson Junior High School in Illinois. I am passionate about history, and believe that we should fix the problems of our past and future, one of which is the environment. I believe that global warming is one of the greatest issues for our generation, and a problem that must be solved, even if you do the bare minimum to solve it. Something small you can do to solve these problems is to not litter, which is why I helped build this game.
